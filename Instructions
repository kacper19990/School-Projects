Variable_a = 25
#This sets your variable to be of value 25, you can set this as a anything
Variable_b = "Duck"
#A variable can also be a string

#Let's put those two things we learned into action.
print(Variable_a)
#Running this in a console will output 25, because this function prints out the value of Variable_a
print(Variable_b)
#This will print out Duck, as our Variable_b is set to print out a string Duck

pri€€nt(Variable_a + Variable_b)
#Combining two variables gives us a combination of the two values. If we were to run this command we would get 25Duck.

Variable_c = Variable_a + Variable_b
#It is easy to assign a new variable by just assigning the value of two or more variables to a new one

print(Variable_c)
#This prints out 25Duck, the same as print(Variable_a + Variable_b)

import time
#Importing a module contains methods, difinitions and classes. We will create a module later on.

#If we want to shorten our module we use "as" after the name of the module as shown above.

Current_time = time.time()

#The two variables shown above both have the same function and contain the same value.

print(Current_T)
#Printing our variable would return something along the lines of "1479159014.109". This doesn't look like our standard time at all.
#This is because .time() function return the amount of seconds passed from "the Unix Epoch" i.e 12:00am January 1, 1970.
#This is a date you might've come across on your phone if you did a factory reset.

print(time.localtime())
#This prints the current time in a more readable format. "tm_year=2016, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=14, tm_hour=21, tm_min=35, tm_sec=51, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=319, tm_isdst=0)"
#You might be wondering what tm_wday, tm_yday, and tm_isdst are.
#Well tm_wday is the weekday. Monday being 0 and Sunday being 6. tm_yday is the day of the year, and tm_isdst check if it's Daylight Saving Time.
#But it's still quite difficult to read. We want to get rid of all the "tm_year=" etc.
print(time.asctime(time.localtime))
#Now this is a readable format for once. "'Mon Nov 14 21:36:14 2016'". We came a long way from the amount of seconds since the Unix Epoch to this.
#You might also have seen that I have put a function inside a function. The fuction asc.time cleans up our time.localtime into a nice format.
time.sleep(5)
#Most of you met time.sleep by now. It creates a pause of x seconds, and then goes onto the next function.

#Say we want to create a quick comman that give us the current date and time.
#We can create a definition to do so. It works similarly to a function, but a definition contains a couple definitions and can contain variables.

#dt.datetime.today converts our YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS into YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS
#This allows the timedelta to determine what day it is today as HH:MM:SS is a string and it reads integers only.
